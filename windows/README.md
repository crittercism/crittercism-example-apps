# Crittercism Windows SDK

Please refer to the [Crittercism Windows SDK Documentation](http://docs.crittercism.com/windows/windows.html).

# Sample Apps

The CrittercismSDK.sln contains example Windows C# applications
demonstrating usage of the Crittercism Windows SDK.  To build
the samples:

1) Open CrittercismSDK.sln in Microsoft Visual Studio (2013 or 2015).

2) Replace strings "YOUR APP ID GOES HERE" with your own App ID
acquired from the Crittercism portal (see Crittercism Windows SDK
Documentation).

3) Use "Manage NuGet Packages ..." to "INSTALL" Crittercism
into the sample app projects.

4) Build, deploy, and run the sample apps.  Exercise the sample
app buttons to set username, leave breadcrumbs, generate handled
exceptions, and generate crashes.  Go to the Crittercism portal
to inspect handled exception reports and crash reports for the
sample apps.
